Closed loop system
After soft-start finishes, reference voltage for the control loop is taken from AN6 (signal AN15 on SEPIC board)

Soft-start and control parameters can be manipulated in the sepic_power_control.c file, in the init_sepic_pwr_control() function declaration:

	sepic_soft_start.counter = 0;                // Reset Soft-Start Counter
    sepic_soft_start.pwr_on_delay = 999;         // Soft-Start Power-On Delay = 100 ms
    sepic_soft_start.ramp_period = 499;          // Soft-Start Ramp Period = 50 ms
    sepic_soft_start.pwr_good_delay = 1999;      // Soft-Start Power Good Delay = 200 ms
    sepic_soft_start.reference = 2204;           // Soft-Start Target Reference = 12V
	
	c2p2z_sepic.ADCTriggerOffset = VOUT_ADC_TRIGGER_DELAY;
    
    c2p2z_sepic.InputOffset = 0;
    
    c2p2z_sepic.MaxOutput = 3600;
    c2p2z_sepic.MinOutput = 10;
    

Soft-start implemented with the following phases:

	1. Soft-Start Power-On Delay
		
		At the end of the phase PWM output and compensator get enabled
		
				
	2. Soft-Start Ramp Period
	
		Every 100 us the voltage reference gets incremented by 4 until it reaches the pre-set reference value.
	
	3. Soft-Start Power Good Delay
	
		Nothing happens here, just waiting for the delay time period to expire before the soft-start is declared to be finished.
